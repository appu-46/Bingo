# Bingo
It is a 2 player bingo game. Another fancy name for it is housie. 
Rules of the game are as follows:
1) Both the players are given a random 5x5 grid of 1 to 25 non-repeating numbers. (Note: Players can make their own grid too, but in my opinion the placement of the numbers doesnt really matter to win the game)
2) Player 1  give a number that has to be striked from both the grids. 
3) Now Player 2 gives a number and again, that numbers has to be striked from the grid.
4) As the round progresses, strikes go on, the strikes should make such a pattern that it covers entire diagonal/row/column of the grid. 
5) Player that gets 5 such strike pattern first, wins the game. 
For eg. 
12X    23    11    14X    25X  
4X     22X    9     24X    8
6X     18X   15X    3X   13X
19X    20X    10    17X    1
21X    7     5     2X     16X

Here 2 diagonals,2 rows,1 columns (Total 5) are striked. Hence this player has won the game. 
If in case, when a player strikes a number and that numbers wins both the players games, then we can consider both of them as joint winners or declare it a draw. 
And thats it! Its a fun game, we used to play on the backside of rough notebook in boring lectures in school.
